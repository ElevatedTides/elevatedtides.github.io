## Built in the late 1970s by the late Jewel Goddard, a lifelong sailor who once crossed the Pacific in a Morgan Out Island 41 sailboat.

Elevated Tides is a unique waterfront destination in Portland, Oregon, offering both a floating sauna experience and a well-established moorage facility on the Columbia River. Located in the Bridgeton neighborhood, just two miles east of the I-5 Bridge, Elevated Tides provides easy access to the river without the hassle of bridge traffic. The moorage features 76 slips and side-tie berths, accommodating boats up to 45 feet in length. It welcomes sailboats, small powerboats, ski boats, fishing boats, cuddy cabin vessels, kayaks, and canoes. Amenities include 30-amp shore power, water on the docks, ample free parking, and a friendly, boater-managed staff dedicated to making the rental process straightforward and enjoyable.

The floating sauna at Elevated Tides offers a serene, wood-fired retreat with panoramic views of the Columbia River, providing guests with a tranquil space to relax and recharge. Whether you’re seeking a peaceful solo escape or a unique group gathering, the sauna experience is designed to promote wellness and connection with nature.

Elevated Tides is committed to maintaining the legacy of the moorage while enhancing the waterfront experience for the community.
